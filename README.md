# SVOL Input File Generator

To use this script, create your desired output directory and update the `OUTPUT_DIR` and `INP_VARS` variables in `generate_inp_files.py `to your desired settings.

Then, run the script with `python3 generate_inp_files.py`.

Note: you will need to have python installed for this to work (this is not hard).
